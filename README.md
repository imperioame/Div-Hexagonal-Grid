# Div-Hexagonal-Grid
A simple honeycomb grid made procedurally with Js, consisting of individual divs clipped as hexagons.

## Known issues:
- There overlapping hexagons. This is due to the recursion algorithm that places divs around previous div. It should check wether the placing position is being used before creating the div.
